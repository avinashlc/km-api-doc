# Krishimandir API

A guide to make use of krishimandir's pathom-json api

#### NOTE

If you are unfamiliar with pathom in general see [pathom's `docs`](https://blog.wsscode.com/pathom/v2/pathom/2.2.0/introduction.html) for more information on eql queries.

## Documentation

### General

- Query structure: `{:query [q1 q2 ...]}`
- All API will be processed by a single `POST` request endpoint: `"/pathom"`
- Resolvers: Used to retrieve value from the backend. kind of like `GET` request

  ```clojure
    - eg1: [:farmers]
    - eg2: [{:farmers {:farmer/id [:farmer/name]}}]
    - eg3: [{[:farmer/id "whateverid"] [:farmer/name :farmer/mobile]}]

    note: the final/nested `[]` will always be the keys that will be resolved and returned from the backend
  ```

- Mutations: Used to `mutate/[update/create]` data in/to the backend. kind of like `POST` request

  ```clojure
    - eg1: [(farmer/push {:farmer/name "whatever" :farmer/mobile "94262985"})]
    - eg2: [(farmer/send-money {:farmer/id "whateverid" :farmer/amount "500000000"})]
  ```

### Farmer

> Resolver

```clojure
    1. [:farmers]
          => all farmer ids
          => returns an array of objects with farmer.id on each object
          => [{"farmer.id": "1"}, {"farmer.id": "2"}]

    2. [{:farmers {:farmer/id [:farmer/id :farmer/name]}}]
          => all farmer data
          => returns an array of objects with farmer.id & farmer.name on each object
          => [{"farmer.id": "1", "farmer.name": "one"}, {"farmer.id": "2", "farmer.name": "two"}]

    3. [{[:farmer/id "1"] [:farmer/id :farmer/mobile]}]
          => a single farmer
          => returns an single farmer object for the given farmer/id
          => [{"farmer.id": "1", "farmer.mobile": "78484"}]

    4. [{[:farmer/location {:state "a" :district "b" :taluka "c" :village "d" :crop "e"}]
         [:filtered-farmers]}]
          => search farmer
          => returns an array of objects with farmer.id on each object
          => [{"farmer.id": "1"}, {"farmer.id": "2"}]

    5. All allowed keys for the farmer resolver
          [:farmer/id => string/uuid
         :farmer/name => string
         :farmer/nickname => string
         :farmer/mobile => string
         :farmer/lang => string/keyword
         :farmer/farms => array
         :farmer/state => string
         :farmer/district => string
         :farmer/sub-districts => string
         :farmer/taluka => string
         :farmer/village => string
         :farmer/favourite-crops => string]
```

> Mutation

```clojure
    1. [(farmer/push {:farmer/name "one", :farmer/mobile "111", `... all allowed keys`})]
        => create new farmer
        => updates an existing farmer if :farmer/id is passed within the data
        => returns created/updated :farmer/id on successful mutation

    2. Example:
        [(farmer/push {:farmer/name "one",
                       :farmer/mobile "111"
                       :farmer/lang "en"
                       :farmer/state "Gujarat"
                       :farmer/district "botad"
                       :farmer/taluka  "taluka"
                       :farmer/favourite-crops ["Apple"]
                       :farmer/farms [{:farm/name "one" :farm/acres 55}]
                       })]

```

> REST

```clojure
    1. "/import-multiple/farmer"
        => POST request
        => Request Body => {"data-file" : excel-file}
        => imports a list of farmers from the excel file to the database
        => NOTE: Not a part of pathom request
    2. "/export-multiple/farmer"
        => GET request
        => exports a base excel sheet with column names prefilled for the client to download and add farmers
        => NOTE: Not a part of pathom request
```

> In JavaScript Ecosystem

```javascript
const allFarmerIDs = "{:query [:farmers]}";
const allFarmerData = "{:query [{:farmers {:farmer/id [:farmer/name]}}]}";
const farmerById = '{:query [{[:farmer/id "1"] [:farmer/id :farmer/mobile]}]}';
```

### location

> Resolvers

```clojure
    1. [:states]
        => all state names
        => ["ASSAM", "KERALA"]

    2. [{[:state "Gujarat"] [:districts]}]
        => all district names by state

    3. [{([:state "Gujarat"] {:pathom/context {:district "botad"}}) [:talukas]}]
        => all talukas names for given district and state
        => NOTE: To pass multiple values as arguments to a query, it needs to be constructed using :pathom/context.
                 It will join whatever is passed to it's map and make it into a single map.
                 Here, the query can be reasoned about like,
                      take {:state "gujarat", :district "botad"} => return [:talukas] for it

    4. [{([:state "Gujarat"] {:pathom/context {:district "botad" :taluka "taluka"}}) [:villages]}]
        => all villages names for given taluka, district and state
        => NOTE: same logic applies as before

```
